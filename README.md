## PREPARE

### Data Source

The data was sourced from an upload named "FitBit Fitness Tracker Data" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbithttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) consisting of 18 CSV files. The dataset generated by thirty respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The data was collected between March, 12th 2016 - May, 12th 2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users submitted personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

### Data Factors and Limitations

- **Data Collection:** The way the data was collected has to be taken into consideration the reason being the data was collected through a survery. This can cause the data to be less accurate for the fact that respondents might not given fully honest or accurtate responses.
- **Sample Size:** Being there are only thirty respondents this sample size would not give us as strong correlations or trends as a larger sample size.
- **Data Age:** FitBit Fitness Tracker Data was collected 7 years ago and updated 3 years ago. The new FitBit tracker devices may be more accurate and reliable.
